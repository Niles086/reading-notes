# The Coder's Computer

When searching for a good text editor, there are several crucial features to consider.

1. Code Completion: A good text editor should offer code completion, which assists developers by suggesting and automatically completing code syntax, making coding faster and reducing errors.

1. Syntax Highlighting: Syntax highlighting is a major feature to identify different parts of your code. It helps in understanding code structure and identifying errors more easily.

1. Variety of Themes: A large selection of themes is valuable for reducing eye strain and fatigue during long coding sessions.

1. Extensions: A good text editor should have a large library of extensions or plugins available. This allows you to setup the editor's functionality to your specific needs, making it a great tool for various coding languages.

These features all enhance the coding experience, making a text editor more efficient, comfortable, and adaptable for developers.

In the world of Windows Command Line Interface (CLI), mastering a few essential commands can significantly enhance your productivity. Let's explore some fundamental commands that can make your file and folder management tasks a breeze.

First up, the **ls** command. This command allows you to list the contents of a directory, giving you a quick overview of what's inside.

         For example the ls projects/new-project command will list the contents of the new-project directory.

Next, we have **mkdir**, which is short for "make directory." This command creates a new folder or directory.

          For example mkdir new-project will create a new folder called new-project in your current directory.

Now, let's talk about the **touch** command. By using touch, you can quickly create new files. This comes in handy when you're starting a new coding project or need to generate empty files for documentation purposes.

         For example touch new-project/newfile.md will create a new file named newfile.md in the new-project directory.

**PWD**, short for **"Print Working Directory,"** reveals your current location in the file system.

The **cd** command, short for "Change Directory," is a basic command it is used to navigate and change your current working directory within the file system.

          For example cd projects command will change your current working directory to the projects folder. Alternativly the cd .. will change the current working directory to the parent directory.

These CLI commands are the building blocks of efficient file and folder management.
