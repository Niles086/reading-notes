# Structure web pages with HTML

HTML **Hypertext Markup Language** is a markup language used to define the structure of web content. It consists of various elements, each of which serves to enclose and define different parts of content, influencing their appearance and behavior on a webpage.

## Three Main Parts of an HTML Element

Each HTML element comprises three fundamental components:

1. The **opening tag**: This marks the beginning of the element and specifies how it should be displayed.
2. The **closing tag**: This marks the end of the element and is used to indicate where the element's effect concludes.
3. The **content**: This is the actual content that the element encapsulates, such as text, images, or other media.

## Attributes and Their Purpose

HTML elements can also include attributes, which provide additional information about the element. These attributes do not directly appear in the content but rather offer extra information for various purposes, like defining behavior or styling.

## Semantic Elements and Their Significance

In HTML, semantic elements play a crucial role in expressing the meaning and purpose of different pieces of code. They help define what an element does or what role it serves, making the structure and content of a webpage more understandable and accessible. Semantic HTML elements contribute to the clarity, organization, and search engine optimization of a webpage.
