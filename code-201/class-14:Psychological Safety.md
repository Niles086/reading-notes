## Discussion Questions

1. What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?
   * The article discusses the importance of psychological safety in team dynamics and how it significantly contributes to a team's success. The researchers at Google, as part of Project Aristotle, aimed to identify the key factors that make teams effective. They found that norms promoting equal participation in conversations (conversational turn-taking) and high social sensitivity were crucial for creating a psychologically safe environment.
2. Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.
   * In my previous professional setting, psychological safety varied across teams. Teams that encouraged open communication, where everyone had a chance to speak and there was a sense of social sensitivity, tended to be more effective. In contrast, teams with dominant leaders or a lack of empathy struggled to foster a psychologically safe atmosphere.
3. What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?
   * Teams operating with a high degree of psychological safety positively impact their company by fostering innovation, problem-solving, and employee well-being. Such teams often experience higher job satisfaction, improved collaboration, and increased productivity, contributing to the overall success of the company. Additionally, team members in psychologically safe environments feel more valued and engaged, leading to better retention and a positive workplace culture.
