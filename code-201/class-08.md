1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.
   *This means that it primarily deals with the arrangement and alignment of elements along a single axis, either horizontally or vertically. In a traditional web layout, you have two dimensions: width (horizontal) and height (vertical). Flexbox simplifies the layout process by focusing on one dimension at a time, which makes it easier to manage and control the positioning and sizing of elements within a container.
2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.
   *The main axis is the axis you define when you set the flex-direction property for the flex container. This property determines whether the main axis is horizontal or vertical. The cross axis is perpendicular to the main axis. If the main axis is horizontal, the cross axis is vertical, and vice versa.
3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?
   * Using flexbox to create variable spacing between elements can lead to inconsistent gaps or overlaps that may affect users with certain disabilities, such as those who use keyboard navigation,flexbox doesn't inherently provide a semantic structure, and it relies heavily on the HTML source order. If the source order is not structured logically or semantically, screen reader users may encounter difficulties in understanding the content.

1. What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?
   * Flexbox makes it much simpler to vertically and horizontally center elements within a container. Floats are not designed for centering and often require additional CSS tricks to achieve the same result.Flexbox allows columns in a row to automatically adjust their height to match the tallest column's height. With floats, equal height columns require extra CSS or JavaScript to accomplish.
