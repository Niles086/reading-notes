## CSS Layout Answers
1. Normal flow refers to the default layout behavior of HTML elements on a web page
2. Inline elements flow within the content and do not start on a new line, block-level elements create a block formatting context and typically start on a new line, taking up the full available width of their parent container. Block-level elements typically force a line break before and after them, creating a clear separation between adjacent content, inline elements do not force line breaks before or after themselves. They can flow within a line of text or other content.
3. Static positioning is the default for every html element.
4. Absolute positioning allows you to specify the exact coordinates (top, right, bottom, left) of an element, elements with absolute positioning can be layered on top of other elements, absolute positioning allows you to create dynamic and responsive layouts.
5. Elements with fixed positioning are positioned relative to the viewport, regardless of their ancestor elements, elements with absolute positioning are positioned relative to their nearest positioned (non-static) ancestor.
