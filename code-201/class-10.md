1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
   * Syntax errors are typically related to violations of the programming language's syntax rules.They occur when you make a mistake in the structure or grammar of your code, such as missing a semicolon, using incorrect syntax, or not closing a parenthesis.
   * Logic errors are related to the program's semantics and logic. They occur when the code's logic is incorrect, leading to unexpected or incorrect behavior.

1. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
   * Some of the errors I have had were typos in variable or function names, sometimes even when I was adding new code to my existing there would be some mismatched variable names. I was able to fix all of these by viewing the console, and reviewing the issues on each line.
  
1. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?
   * They will make me more mindful when writing code. But also give me a firm foundation in troubleshooting my code.
  
## [The JavaScript Debugger.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools#the_javascript_debugger)

1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
   * The JavaScript Debugger is a feature or tool provided by most web browsers, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and others, that helps you find and fix errors in your JavaScript code. It allows you to pause the execution of your code and inspect the program's state at that moment.
   * When you start using the Debugger, you can place "breakpoints" in your code. When the code execution reaches a breakpoint, it pauses, allowing you to inspect the values of variables, see the call stack, and step through the code line by line. You can also watch the values of variables and expressions, which helps you understand what's happening in your code and where potential issues might be. You can use various controls like "step into," "step over," and "continue" to move through your code and observe how it behaves. By observing the program's behavior at specific points in your code, you can identify logic errors, unexpected values, or issues that cause your program to misbehave.
  
2. Define what a breakpoint is.
   * A breakpoint is a marker that tells the browser to stop executing your code at a specific line. 
  
3. What is the call stack?
   *  It is a data structure that keeps track of the execution context of a program, specifically for function calls.
