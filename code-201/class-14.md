## [CSS Transforms](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/css-transforms/)

1. What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?
   * CSS transform is a tool that lets developers visually alter elements by translating (moving), rotating, scaling, skewing, or applying matrix transformations. This allows for flexible and dynamic adjustments to the appearance of elements without affecting the overall document layout.
2. Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.
   
                .rotate-example {
                transform: rotate(45deg);
                }

   *  This CSS rule would rotate an element with the class "rotate-example" by 45 degrees. This could be applied to a website's navigation menu icon to create a dynamic and visually appealing animation when the menu opens or to add a unique design element to other page elements.            


# [CSS Transitions & Animations](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/transitions-animations/)

1. What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?
   * A CSS transition allows developers to smoothly animate the changes in CSS properties of an element over a specified duration. It provides a way to add gradual and controlled effects to elements, such as fading in/out, changing colors, or moving positions.
2. How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?
   * CSS transitions are simpler and are primarily used to animate changes between two states of an element. These changes are triggered by events like hovering or clicking.
   * CSS animations offer more flexibility and control. They allow developers to create more complex and customized animations with multiple keyframes, defining various intermediate states and specifying the duration and timing functions for each.
