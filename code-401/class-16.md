1. Characteristics of Serverless Computing and Differences from Traditional Server-Based Architectures:

Key Characteristics of Serverless Computing:

Event-Driven: Serverless functions are triggered by events (e.g., HTTP requests, changes in data).
Automatic Scaling: Resources are automatically provisioned and scaled based on demand.
Pay-per-Use: Users are billed based on actual usage, not pre-allocated resources.
No Server Management: Developers focus on writing code, without dealing with server provisioning or maintenance.
Stateless: Functions are stateless and designed to handle individual events independently.
Short-Lived: Functions are typically short-lived, executing for the duration of an event.
Differences from Traditional Server-Based Architectures:

In traditional server-based architectures, developers manage and provision servers, handle scaling manually, and often pay for resources regardless of usage. In contrast, serverless computing abstracts infrastructure management, automatically scales, and charges based on actual usage.
2. Getting Started with Vercel and Deploying Serverless Functions:

Steps:
Create a Vercel Account: Sign up on the Vercel platform.
Install Vercel CLI: Install the Vercel Command Line Interface (CLI) globally using npm.

            npm install -g vercel

Login to Vercel: Run vercel login to authenticate your account.
Navigate to Project Directory: Use the command line to navigate to your project directory.
Deploy a Function: Run vercel in the terminal and follow the prompts. Select the appropriate function deployment.
Access the Deployed Function: Vercel provides a URL where your function is deployed.
3. APIs and Utilizing Them in Python Applications:

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):

APIs define how software components should interact. They allow one software application to access and use the functionality/data of another application, service, or platform.
Utilizing APIs in Python:

HTTP Requests: APIs often use HTTP/HTTPS for communication.
JSON: Data is commonly exchanged in JSON format.
Python Libraries: Python provides libraries like requests for making HTTP requests and interacting with APIs.
4. Requests Library in Python and Basic GET Request Example:

Requests Library:

requests is a popular Python library for making HTTP requests.
Example of a Basic GET Request:


                    import requests

                    # Specify the API endpoint URL
                    api_url = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1"

                    # Send a GET request
                    response = requests.get(api_url)

                    # Check if the request was successful (status code 200)
                    if response.status_code == 200:
                        # Parse and print the response JSON
                        data = response.json()
                        print("Title:", data['title'])
                    else:
                        print("Error:", response.status_code)


                        
This example uses the JSONPlaceholder API to fetch a todo item. The requests.get method is used to send a GET request, and the response is then processed, checking for success and extracting data from the JSON response.
