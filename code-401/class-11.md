# Jupyter Lab vs. Jupyter Notebook:

Jupyter Lab and Jupyter Notebook are both interactive computing environments, but Jupyter Lab extends the capabilities of Jupyter Notebook. The key features of Jupyter Lab include a more flexible and extensible interface that allows users to work with documents, code, and data in a more integrated manner. Jupyter Lab supports multiple tabs, enabling users to work on different documents simultaneously. It provides an integrated file explorer, a command palette for quick access to commands, and the ability to view side-by-side documents. Jupyter Lab also supports a wide range of file formats beyond notebooks, such as images, CSV, and more. While Jupyter Notebook remains popular for its simplicity, Jupyter Lab offers a more comprehensive environment for interactive computing.

## NumPy Library in Python:

NumPy is a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. Key functionalities of NumPy include efficient operations on arrays, mathematical functions, linear algebra operations, random number generation, and tools for integrating with other low-level languages. NumPy is particularly beneficial for scientific computing, data analysis, and manipulation tasks, as it allows for fast and memory-efficient operations on large datasets.

## Basic Structure and Properties of NumPy Arrays:

NumPy arrays are homogeneous, multi-dimensional data structures with a fixed size. The basic properties include shape, size, data type, and dimensionality. You can create NumPy arrays using various methods:

## Creating Arrays:


                    import numpy as np

                    # Creating a 1D array
                    arr_1d = np.array([1, 2, 3])

                    # Creating a 2D array
                    arr_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

                    # Creating arrays with zeros and ones
                    zeros_arr = np.zeros((2, 3))
                    ones_arr = np.ones((3, 2))

                    # Creating an array with a range of values
                    range_arr = np.arange(0, 10, 2)

                    # Creating a random array
                    random_arr = np.random.random((2, 2))


## Array Manipulation:


                    # Reshaping an array
                    reshaped_arr = arr_1d.reshape((3, 1))

                    # Slicing and indexing
                    sliced_arr = arr_2d[:, 1]

                    # Concatenating arrays
                    concatenated_arr = np.concatenate((arr_1d, arr_1d))


## Array Operations:


            # Element-wise operations
            sum_arr = arr_1d + arr_1d
            dot_product = np.dot(arr_2d[0], arr_2d[1])

            # Universal functions (ufuncs)
            exp_arr = np.exp(arr_1d)


NumPy's array operations and efficient memory management make it a powerful tool for various numerical and scientific computing tasks in Python.
