# Differences between Scraping Static and Dynamic Websites:
Rendering Content:

Static Websites: The content is present in the HTML source code, and no additional rendering is required. Data extraction is relatively straightforward.
Dynamic Websites: Content is often loaded dynamically using JavaScript. Scraping may require rendering the page to execute JavaScript and retrieve the dynamically generated content.
Data Retrieval:

Static Websites: Data can be extracted directly from the HTML source using libraries like BeautifulSoup in Python.
Dynamic Websites: Data retrieval may involve interacting with the DOM (Document Object Model) after JavaScript execution. This can be done using tools like Puppeteer or Playwright.
AJAX Requests:

Static Websites: Usually, all data is present in the initial HTML response.
Dynamic Websites: Additional data may be fetched through AJAX requests after the page has loaded. Scraping dynamic websites may involve capturing and simulating these requests.
Techniques to Avoid Getting Blocked While Scraping:
Use of Headers:

Send headers in your HTTP requests that mimic a legitimate browser request. Include common headers like User-Agent, Accept-Language, and Referer to make your requests look more like those from a real user.
Rate Limiting:

Implement rate-limiting to avoid sending too many requests in a short period. Mimic human-like behavior by introducing delays between requests.
Proxy Rotation:

Rotate IP addresses by using a pool of proxies. This helps distribute requests across different IP addresses, reducing the likelihood of getting blocked.
Playwright in Web Scraping:
Playwright is a Node library for automating browsers. It provides a high-level API to interact with web pages, enabling actions like navigating, clicking, and scraping data from pages with dynamic content.

Use Case:

Suppose you want to scrape a website that heavily relies on JavaScript to load content dynamically. Playwright can be beneficial in automating interactions with the page, allowing you to wait for elements to load before extracting data.
Example:


                    const { chromium } = require('playwright');

                    (async () => {
                    const browser = await chromium.launch();
                    const page = await browser.newPage();
                    
                    await page.goto('https://example.com');
                    await page.waitForSelector('.dynamic-element');
                    
                    const dynamicData = await page.$eval('.dynamic-element', (element) => element.textContent.trim());
                    console.log('Dynamic Data:', dynamicData);

                    await browser.close();
                    })();

Xpath in Web Scraping:
Purpose:

Xpath (XML Path Language): It is a query language for selecting nodes from an XML document or an HTML page. In web scraping, Xpath is often used to navigate the HTML structure and locate specific elements.
Example Xpath Expression:

Suppose you want to select the text inside a paragraph (<p>) with a specific class, e.g., <p class="example">Hello, World!</p>. The Xpath expression would be:

            //p[@class='example']

This expression selects any <p> element with the attribute class equal to 'example'.
