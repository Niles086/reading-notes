# Differences Between Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh:

Matplotlib:

Features: Matplotlib is a comprehensive 2D plotting library that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
Use Cases: Matplotlib is versatile and can be used for various plot types, from simple line plots to complex 3D visualizations.
Example: A basic line plot showing the trend of a variable over time.
Seaborn:

Features: Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. It specializes in statistical data visualization with a focus on ease of use and aesthetics.
Use Cases: Seaborn is particularly useful for visualizing complex datasets and statistical relationships. It excels in creating informative and aesthetically pleasing visualizations with minimal code.
Example: A scatter plot with a linear regression line to show the relationship between two variables.
Bokeh:

Features: Bokeh is a interactive visualization library that targets modern web browsers for presentation. It allows for interactive and real-time plotting with web-based outputs.
Use Cases: Bokeh is ideal for creating interactive and dynamic visualizations that can be embedded in web applications. It's well-suited for applications where user interaction is a key element.
Example: An interactive scatter plot that allows users to zoom in and pan to explore the data.

## Seaborn Plotting Functions:

Relational Plots: sns.relplot()

Purpose: Used for visualizing the relationship between two numerical variables. It creates scatter plots, line plots, or other types of relational plots.
Example Use Case: Visualizing the correlation between a person's age and income in a dataset.
Categorical Plots: sns.catplot()

Purpose: Designed for visualizing the distribution of categorical data. It can create box plots, violin plots, bar plots, etc., to show the distribution within categories.
Example Use Case: Comparing the distribution of scores among different groups in a survey.
Distribution Plots: sns.distplot() and sns.kdeplot()

Purpose: Used for visualizing univariate distributions. distplot combines histograms and kernel density estimates, while kdeplot focuses on kernel density estimates.
Example Use Case: Analyzing the distribution of exam scores in a class.
## Seaborn Cheat Sheet:

The Seaborn Cheat Sheet serves as a quick reference for Python developers working with Seaborn. Key sections include:

Plotting Functions: It lists essential plotting functions with a brief description of each, helping developers choose the appropriate function for their visualization needs.

Axes-level Functions: This section outlines functions for creating specific types of plots, such as scatter plots, bar plots, and violin plots, enhancing efficiency in plot selection.

Figure-level Functions: Developers can quickly grasp the differences between relplot, catplot, and other figure-level functions, understanding when to use each for optimal results.

Customization Options: The cheat sheet highlights customization options, such as color palettes and themes, allowing developers to enhance the visual appeal of their plots effortlessly.

Statistical Estimation: Describes functions for incorporating statistical estimation in plots, such as adding regression lines or confidence intervals.

Overall, the Seaborn Cheat Sheet is a valuable resource for Python developers, streamlining the process of creating effective and aesthetically pleasing visualizations with Seaborn.
