## Growth Mindset

To me the term growth mindset means that not a single person on this planet was born with the knowledge to do anything in life. We all had to learn, we all had to seek education for what we wanted to learn. From the time we are born we must keep that mindset wither we are conscious of it or not. This can be applied to learning to walk, learning to read, or even this Class. The belief that we are capable of learning and putting in the work is a growth mindset to me.
To maintain my growth mindset for this course I remind myself of three things to keep me motivated and on track.

1. Nothing in life worth having comes easy. This class may be hard at times but if I put in the work, I can do it.
2. Iâ€™m bound to make mistakes. The important thing is not to repeat them and learn from them.
3. Finally my father went through a similar course in 2018 and now has a high paying work from home position, and if I want the same. Then I must succeed
