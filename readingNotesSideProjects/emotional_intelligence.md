# Reflection on Emotional Intelligence

## Final Scores

 Self-Awareness = 19, Self-Management = 18, Social Awareness = 21, Relationship Management = 20

## Summary

In reflecting on my Emotional Intelligence (EI) assessment results, I'm pleased to see that I've scored above the minimum threshold of 18 in three out of four EI domains: Self-Awareness, Social Awareness, and Relationship Management. This indicates that I possess a solid level of awareness about my emotions and those of others, and I'm effective in managing my relationships.

However, my Self-Management score is slightly lower at 18. This result suggests that there's room for improvement when it comes to self-regulation and handling my emotions in challenging situations. I recognize that this is an area where I can focus my efforts to further enhance my EI.

The positive aspect is that I understand that Emotional Intelligence is a skill that can be developed and refined. I'm committed to taking steps to improve in this area. Seeking feedback from others, engaging in mentorship within my organization, and dedicating time to reading books and participating in seminars related to Emotional Intelligence are all strategies that I'm eager to pursue.

By working on my Self-Management skills, I'm confident that I can become more resilient and better equipped to navigate complex emotional situations, ultimately enhancing my overall emotional intelligence and fostering more meaningful and productive relationships both personally and professionally.
