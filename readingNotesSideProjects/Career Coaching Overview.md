# Career Coaching Overview

In embarking on this new educational journey, my primary aim is to expand my skill set and broaden my horizons. With 16 years of experience in infrastructure and networking, I see coding as the missing piece that could significantly enhance my expertise. The timing of this endeavor is fueled by a desire to break through the glass ceiling I've encountered in my career. I'm seeking the opportunity for a remote position that not only offers greater autonomy but also comes with a commensurate increase in salary. However, the deeper motivation underlying this pursuit lies in my yearning to transition from simply maintaining existing systems to actively creating and innovating. I'm eager to harness the power of coding to craft solutions, bring new ideas to life, and contribute to the evolution of technology.
