1. Who is Roy Fielding?
2. Why don’t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
4. What does a GET do?
5. What does a POST do?
6. What does PUT do?

## Answers

Roy Fielding is a computer scientist known for his contributions to the development of the first web servers and his extensive research explaining the principles behind the World Wide Web. He played a key role in creating the HTTP protocol and is a significant figure in the development of the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style.

The techniques discussed in the conversation likely refer to the traditional methods of communication between machines, such as SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol). These methods were not well-suited for talking to all machines in the world and lacked the universality and simplicity that HTTP and REST provide.

HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It is a protocol used for transferring hypertext requests and information between browsers and servers.

GET: The HTTP GET method is used to retrieve data from a specified resource. In the context of the web, it is commonly used to request web pages and their associated resources (images, stylesheets, etc.).

POST: The HTTP POST method is used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource. It is often used when uploading a file or submitting a form on a web page.

PUT: The HTTP PUT method is used to update a resource or create a new resource if it does not exist at the specified URL. It replaces the entire resource with the new data provided.

PATCH: The HTTP PATCH method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource. It is used when you want to apply changes to a part of a resource without modifying the entire structure.

API Keys
Request a personal API key from the following APIs. You should receive these in your email within a few hours, often within minutes. Please request these keys prior to lecture to allow adequate time because you will need them in order to complete your lab assignment. Note: do not post your API keys in the Canvas discussion or on GitHub. Save them in a secure place.
