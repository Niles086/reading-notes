# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry


1. The Decline in Women in Computer Science:
The decline in women pursuing computer science occurred around the time personal computers became prevalent in U.S. homes. The narrative that computers were for boys emerged, influenced by marketing and cultural perceptions. This led to a decline in the number of women in computer science as personal computers were marketed predominantly to men and boys.

2. Significance of Males Playing on Computers:
The fact that males had been playing on computers growing up mattered because it contributed to a stereotype that computers were a male-oriented interest. Families were more likely to buy computers for boys, creating a disparity in early exposure to technology. As a result, by the time students entered college, male students often had an advantage, having grown up playing with computers. This historical trend has had lasting effects on the gender gap in computer science, emphasizing the importance of addressing these disparities for promoting diversity in the field.


1. When are diversity efforts most successful?
Diversity efforts are most successful when they are driven by a genuine commitment from company leaders. Meaningful commitment involves leaders understanding why diversity matters to their specific company. Success in diversity and inclusion efforts requires leaders to prioritize and allocate appropriate resources, both internally and externally. The commitment of company leaders is crucial for creating an inclusive culture.

2. Why do diverse companies perform better?
Diverse companies perform better for several reasons. Firstly, diverse teams are smarter and more creative, bringing varied perspectives and approaches to problem-solving. Secondly, there is a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes. Studies show that diverse companies are associated with better financial performance. Thirdly, diverse companies attract a wider pool of talent, leading to more innovative and effective teams. Lastly, diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base, ensuring that products and services are designed to meet the needs of a broad range of users.

3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vice versa.
An example of how a diverse company can better serve a diverse user base is illustrated by Tracy Chou's experience at Pinterest. When she shared the company's demographic information, she emphasized that the quality and impact of products improve when the people building them are representative of the user base. In the case of YouTube, an almost entirely right-handed developer team overlooked the needs of left-handed users, resulting in a significant percentage of uploaded videos being upside down. By having a diverse team that reflects the diversity of users, companies can avoid such oversights and build more inclusive and user-friendly products.
