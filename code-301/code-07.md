[An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js)

1. What is node.js?
   Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to execute JavaScript code on their computers, providing a server-side runtime environment. Node.js is event-based, non-blocking, and asynchronous, making it suitable for handling a large number of simultaneous connections.
2. In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?
   Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine is an open-source engine that runs in web browsers like Google Chrome. It compiles JavaScript code directly to native machine code for execution. Node.js utilizes V8 but is not executed in a browser. Instead, Node.js enhances V8 with features like a file system API and HTTP library for server-side operations.
3. What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?
   Node.js serves as a JavaScript runtime, allowing the execution of JavaScript code on a computer outside of a browser environment. It facilitates server-side development by providing additional functionalities beyond what the browser-based V8 engine offers.
4. What is npm?
   npm is a package manager for JavaScript that comes bundled with Node.js. It is the world's largest software registry, hosting over a million JavaScript packages available for download. Developers use npm to install, manage, and share packages, libraries, and dependencies for their projects.
5. What version of node are you running on your machine? v21.1.0
6. What version of npm are you running on your machine? 10.2.0
7. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’? To install a library or package globally, use the command: npm install -g jshint. To install a library or package locally, use the command: npm install jshint.
8. What is node used for?
   Node.js is suitable for building applications with real-time interaction or collaboration, such as chat sites or collaborative editing platforms. It excels in handling APIs with numerous I/O-driven requests and is ideal for sites involving data streaming. Additionally, Node.js is commonly used to run JavaScript on the server, providing efficiency and scalability.


[6 Reasons for Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
   Greater Efficiency:

Pair programming helps catch mistakes early, leading to higher-quality code that requires less troubleshooting and debugging. While it may take slightly longer, the overall efficiency is increased due to improved code quality.
Engaged Collaboration:

Two programmers working together on the same codebase creates a more engaging experience. The focus is enhanced, and there's less room for procrastination or distraction. The shared responsibility encourages commitment to completing the work.
Learning from Fellow Students:

Pair programming exposes developers to different problem-solving approaches. Working with a teammate can introduce new techniques and solutions that one might not have considered alone. It promotes knowledge exchange and skill sharing.
Social Skills:

Pair programming improves social skills by necessitating effective communication and collaboration. When developers have different coding styles and personalities, finding common ground and expressing ideas become essential. It contributes to better interpersonal skills.
Job Interview Readiness:

Pair programming is often part of job interviews, where applicants collaborate with current employees on coding exercises. It provides companies with insights into an applicant's collaboration style, problem-solving abilities, and communication skills.
Work Environment Readiness:

Many companies use pair programming in their work environment. Graduates familiar with pair programming, like those from Code Fellows, can seamlessly transition into such work environments. This familiarity with collaborative coding practices reduces the learning curve for new hires.
2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
   In my experience, the most beneficial aspect of pair programming is Learning from Fellow Students. The exposure to different problem-solving approaches and the opportunity to learn new techniques from a teammate have proven valuable.
3. How does pair programming work?
   Driver:

The programmer actively typing and managing the text editor, version control, and coding tasks. The Driver is responsible for the mechanics of coding.
Navigator:

The programmer guiding the Driver verbally, thinking about the big picture, planning the next steps, and scanning for errors. The Navigator does not directly input code but provides guidance and support.
